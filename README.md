# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project used Excel to analyze theh success/fail rates of kickstarter campaigns for plays in order to compare to Louise's play --Fever--.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to review the success / fail rates of kickstarter campigns in an attempt to identify the time of year and most successful goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When calculating the outcomes based on goal, I was concerned that the formula I used to calculate the number canceled returned a zero value for all goals.  To verify that zero was the correct answer, I went to the main worksheet and filtered by each criteria and verified that zero was the correct result.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The number of projects that cancel is low and generally consistie
2. Projects that launch in Decmeber have a lower success rate.  However, there is nearly an equal success / failure rate.
2. While the success to failure rate is fairly consistent throughout the year (except December as noted above), projects that launch in spring / early summer are more successful.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 1. This dataset does not provide socioeconomic data such as age, education, and income.
 2. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
